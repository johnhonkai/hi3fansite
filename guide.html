    <div><h1>Astral Ring System</h1></div>
    <div class="guidecontainer"><h4>What is Astral Ring System?</h4>
    <div>Valkyries in Part 2 (released from v7.3 onwards) use a new system called Astral Ring (AR).<br/>
        In this guide, you will learn all about the Astral Ring system and how it differs from Part 1 valkyries.<br/><br/>
        <h4>BEGINNER LEVEL</h4>
        A valk with AR system has these properties:<br/>
        
        1. A valk has ONE AR specialization. There are 12 AR specializations, but we only know 3 so far.<br/>
        2. Each AR specialization has a connected AR trait. A valk can have MULTIPLE AR traits.<br/>
        3. Has a Stellar Outburst skill that charges up using a new meter called Astral Ring intensity.<br/>
        4. When AR intensity is full, you can activate Stellar Outburst, which grants various effects depending 
        on the AR specialization and the valkyrie herself.<br/>
        5. Can use AstralOp support. ELF will also become AstralOp. Unlike ELF, AstralOp does not remain on the field. AstralOp provides buffs, and
        when you activate Stellar Outburst, AstralOp will deal Assist ATK.

            <h5>1. AR SPECIALIZATION</h5>
            Valkyries in Part 2 (released from v7.3 onwards) use a new system called <span style="color:rgb(147, 221, 240)">Astral Ring (AR).</span> <br/>
            - A valk can only have ONE AR Specialization.<br/>
            - There are 12 AR specializations, but we only know 3 so far (World Star, Wheel of Destiny, Rite of Oblivion). <br/><br/>

            <img src="assets/guide/ar1.png">

            <b>DPS and SUPPORT</b><br/>
            - S-rank Part 2 valkyrie can be both a DPS and a SUPPORT.<br/>
            - When a Part 2 valk becomes the leader, she becomes the DPS and activates her Astral Ring specialization.</br>
            - For example, if we set Senadina [Deepspace Anchor] as the leader, she becomes the DPS, and AR World Star is activated. So Sena will be called as World Star DPS (also called Resonance DPS).

            <div class="breakline"></div>

            <h5>2. AR ATTRIBUTE</h5>
            Every AR specialization has a connected AR attribute. A valkyrie can have multiple AR attributes.</li>

            <img src="assets/guide/ar3.png">

            <h5>So, what does AR Attribute do?</h5>
            <b><span style="color:rgb(255, 209, 123)">[FOR WORLD STAR and WHEEL OF DESTINY]</span></b><br/>
            - AR attribute indicates that the valk can support another valk with the connected AR specialization.</br/>
            - AR attribute also activates or allow certain buffs to reach max effect. Part 2 valkyrie skills, weapon, stigma and AstralOp effects require specific AR specialization and/or AR attribute to be activated, or to reach maximum effect.</br/>
            - For example: Deepspace Anchor has Domain Resonance tag and Harmonized Shadow Star traits. 
                That means she can support World Star DPS and Wheel of Destiny DPS.

            <br/><br/>
            <b><span style="color:rgb(91, 243, 248)">[FOR RITE OF OBLIVION]</span></b><br/>
            1. As a support, Rite of Oblivion characters can support any Astral Ring team.

            <div class="breakline"></div> 

            <h5>3. LEADER SKILL</h5>
            One of the important skills that require specific AR attribute is the leader skill. If you take a look at the example below, Part 2 leader skills
            are three times as long as Part 1 valk leader skills, and have strong buffs such as independent multiplier.
            <img src="assets/guide/arleader.png">
            
            <br/>
            In the lineup menu, there are some indicators
            that display the compatible teammates that can make the leader buff reach maximum effect. <br/>
            <img src="assets/guide/ar4.png">


            <br/>
            <b>Rite of Oblivion can activate any leader skill</b><br/>
            Rite of Oblivion (RoO) has a connected AR attribute tag Omniscient Star -
            which counts the valk for the leader skill's AR-specific requirement. Only leader skill okay~ This does not count towards other skills, weapon, and stigma effects that require AR-specific attribute.

            <b>So, what does AR Attribute do?</b><br/>
            

            <div class="breakline"></div>
                        
            <h5>3. ASTRAL OP</h5>
            
            When AR is activated, you can equip Astral Op.<br/>
            Just like the valkyrie teambuilding, AstralOp buffs are also general but require AR-specific valkyries to activate the buffs.<br/><br/>

            <b>Difference with ELF</b><br/>
            In the context of S-rank AstralOp and ELF:<br/>
            - Just like Part 2 weapon and stigma, AstralOp's buffs are more general, and require AR-specific valkyries to activate buff, or to reach max buffs.<br/>
            - The biggest difference of AstralOp compared to Elf is that AstralOp gives AR meter regen, which allows you to activate Stellar Outburst much faster. This means there is a big difference in rotation with and without S-rank AstralOp.<br/>
            - In Part 1 team, ELF only gives buffs and utility like switch cd reduction, but not sp regen. Even without an S-rank ELF, rotations are usually the same (in Abyss) with and without ELF.
